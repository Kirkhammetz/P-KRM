# [P-KRM Boilerplate](https://github.com/Kirkhammetz/P-KRM)

**Still Work in Progress**

Time to try something fresh :)

Javascript Full Stack Framework featuring:

- PostgreSQL
- Koa2
- React
- Redux
- Material-UI
- ES2017
- Webpack

Structure will be similar to the [React/Express](https://github.com/Kirkhammetz/react-redux-adminLTE-FullStack-boilerplate) boilerplate:

- Rendered views for the public routes + Single components or vanillaJS
- Admin Dashboard as a React SPA.

**Still Work in Progress**
